### Boot Camp Homework 6 - Weather Dashboard
This website detailed weather information for a city, followed by a 5-day forecast for that city.

If the search is successful, it will update the main display with detailed information and the 5-day forecast. If the search string is not found, or if a blank search is sent, an error message is shown.

There is also a display of a history of searched cities, with clickable links to access cities in the history. The list dynamically updates, placing the most recent searches at the top of the list.

This page uses localstorage to maintain the search history (max 10 cities).
